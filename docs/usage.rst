============
Usage
============

These are two command line scripts; one generates HC thickness maps, the
other makes average maps

::

   grid3d_hc_thickness --config myfile_hc.yml

   grid3d_average_map --config myfile_avg.yml


-------------------------
Override the Eclipse root
-------------------------

For both scripts, some settings in the YAML file can be overridden by
the command line, which can be useful in ERT setups::

   grid3d_hc_thickness --config myfile.yml --eclroot GULLFAKS

-----------------------------
Possible command line options
-----------------------------

Type::

  grid3d_hc_thickness --help

  grid3d_average_map --help

-----------------------------
Tuning speed of the scripts
-----------------------------
In cases with large grids and many layers, computing can take a lot of time
as the internal griddata routine is not as fast as wished. The workaround
here is to use the tuning option in computesettings, e.g::

 computesettings:
   tuning:
     zone_avg: Yes
     coarsen: 3

Here, "zone_avg" means that a weighted average is done per zone, prior to the
2D mapping. Then, only the zone averages are gridded, which can speed up
the computing a lot.

Another option is "coarsen". If set to 3 as above, only every 3'rd grid cell
will be applied in the gridding.

Note however, that both options will inevitably reduce the *quality* of the
result, so there is a trade-off here. Se example :ref:`HC thickness 1i`.

------------------------------------------
Inactive map outside grid for HC thickness
------------------------------------------

With the average script, the resulting map will be inactive where the thickness
is zero. For the HC sum script, you need to active a setting in order to get
this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   computesettings:
     mask_outside: Yes


---------------------------------------
Using dates directly from global_config
---------------------------------------

From version 0.4 (experimental!)

For the thickness script, dates can now be loaded from the global_variables.yml
file, e.g. as:

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     eclroot: tests/data/reek/REEK
     dates: !include_from ../../share/fmuconfig/output/global_variables.yml::global.DATES
     diffdates: !include_from  ../../share/fmuconfig/output/global_variables.yml::global.DIFFDATES

Note that dates and diffdates are two separate lists
