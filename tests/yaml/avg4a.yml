# For filters, there are properties defined at the same grid layout as
# the grid read in input
#
# If several filters, they will be cumulative.
#
# In this case a ZONE filter is used instead of an explicit "zonation" setting; need
# in most cases to be combined with "prefix" setting under "output"

filters:
  - name: PORO
    source: $eclroot.INIT
    intvrange: [0.0, 1.0] # Filter for a continuous will be an interval
  - name: FACIES
    discrete: Yes
    source: tests/data/reek/reek_sim_facies2.roff
    discrange: [2] # Filter for a discrete will be spesic number sequence
  - name: Zone
    discrete: Yes
    source: tests/data/reek/reek_sim_zone.roff
    discrange: [2, 3] # Filter for a discrete will be spesic number sequence

computesettings:
  zone: No
  all: Yes
  mask_zeros: Yes # means that ouput maps will be set to undef where zero

# map definition (unrotated maps only, for rotated maps use a maptemplate...)
