Various scripts for generating maps from 3D grid properties.

## Scripts included

| Script                  |     Description     |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| `grid3d_hc_thickness`   | Make Hydrocarbon thickness maps from Eclipse and/or Roff input |
| `grid3d_average_map`    | Make average maps from a 3D grid parameter, Eclipse or Roff input |
| `grid3d_aggregate_map`  | Make aggregated maps (min/max/mean/sum) from a 3D grid parameter, Eclipse or Roff input |
| `grid3d_migration_time` | Make migration time maps aimed at tracking plume migration in CCS applications |

## Features

- From Eclipse files (EGRID, INIT, UNRST) and/or RMS binary ROFF
  make HCPV thickness maps, or make weighted average maps
  - No need to invoke RMS
  - Efficient in FMU work flows
  - HC thickness maps and average maps for property differences is
    supported (see examples in YAML config files)
- Outputs PNG figures and Irap (RMS) binary maps
- Simple configuration through a YAML file
- Configuration from YAML can be overriden by command line options
- From version 1.3, output via `fmu-dataio`_ (to `sumo`_) is supported.
  See [fmu-dataio](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-dataio/) and
